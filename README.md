Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates).
Aim of the app:
- Connect skitourers;
- Suggest routes and itineraries;
- Enable skitourers to insert new routes;
- Possibility to add photos and reviews of each route.

Special thanks to outdooractive.com for their great API and enabling me to scrape a substantial amount of data.
